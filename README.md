## Overview

V4 Oracle Predict combines DeFi engagement with gamification by rewarding users with points for participating in Uniswap V4 pools. Users earn points for swapping ETH for tokens and for providing liquidity. The project introduces game mechanics like streak bonuses, referral incentives, and a jackpot system.

## Key Features

- **Points Reward System**: Earn points for swapping ETH for tokens (20% of ETH spent) and adding liquidity (1:1 with ETH added)
- **Streak Bonuses**: Consistent activity builds a streak with escalating bonuses:
  - 3+ consecutive interactions: 10% bonus
  - 5+ consecutive interactions: 20% bonus
  - 10+ consecutive interactions: 50% bonus
- **Referral System**: Earn 10% of the points generated by users you refer
- **Jackpot Mechanics**: Chance to win the accumulated jackpot pool when performing larger swaps
- **Frontend Simulator**: Interactive UI to visualize and simulate the rewards system

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract

The core of the project is the `PointsHook` contract which implements the Uniswap V4 hook interface. The hook:

1. Monitors pool events (swaps and liquidity additions)
2. Tracks user interaction streaks
3. Issues ERC20 tokens as points
4. Maintains a jackpot pool
5. Processes referrals

### How It Works

- **Hook Permissions**: The contract hooks into `afterAddLiquidity` and `afterSwap` events
- **Point Minting Logic**: Points are minted based on ETH liquidity added or ETH spent in swaps
- **Data Passing**: User addresses (and optional referrers) are passed via hook data
- **Jackpot Mechanism**: A percentage of all ETH volume contributes to the jackpot

## Game Mechanics

The frontend provides a simulated environment where users can:

1. Predict "Oracle Signals" based on simulated data feeds
2. Earn points for correct predictions
3. Build streaks for increased rewards
4. Compete for jackpots
5. Track performance history

### Prediction Types

- **Signal Prediction**: Predict a single data point from either feed
- **Combined Signal**: Predict the combination of both feeds
- **Unique Oracle Pattern**: Predict patterns with 3 unique values
- **Repeating Oracle Pattern**: Predict patterns with repeated values
- **Consensus Oracle Pattern**: Predict complete alignment with jackpot chance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
